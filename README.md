# pystrodynamics

## About
`pystrodynamics` is a spacecraft dynamics library and simulation framework in Python. It is intended to work akin to NASA's [GMAT](https://opensource.gsfc.nasa.gov/projects/GMAT/index.php) or [Orekit](https://www.orekit.org/), but by virtue of being written in Python, is more accessible to a wider range of users who can more easily extend and modify it to their needs.

`pystrodynamics` is a library built on the shoulders of others. Heavily used are [Skyfield](https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/) and [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/), alongside the ever-present [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [scipy](https://scipy.org/) libraries.
